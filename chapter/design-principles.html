    <h1>Design Principles</h1>
    <hr>

   <p id="p-subtitle">
      The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation in team sports through
      online communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this goal
      if the application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are applied
      to achieve a user-centric solution.

  <h2>User Experience Design</h2>

  <p>The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple
    <cite>(NORMAN,
      2013, P. XIII F.)</cite>. User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its
    services, and
    its products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every
    aspects. Close cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic
    design, industrial design, and interface design <cite>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</cite>.
  </p>


  <p class="cite-text"><i><strong>»Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good
        designs fit
        our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on
        the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.«</strong></i></p>
  <cite>- Don Norman</cite>



  <p>User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals, the haptics,
    and the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors: its look,
    feel, and usability <cite>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04)</cite>.</p>

  <p>User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and behavior of the user. Understanding how
    users perceive a product allows user experience designers to iterate their concepts and better achieve the user’s
    goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah Diefenbach’s paper <em>Well-being</em>, <em>Need Fulfillment</em>, and <em>Experience
      Design</em>, any positive experience is based on meeting psychological needs. The fulfillment of psychological needs,
    such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to the well-being of the user and
    leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in
    the design process <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</p>

  <p>Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the following, they are considered from the
    perspective of emotion, while additional needs are addressed.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Competence</dt>
    <dd> Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of thinking that
      one is
      incapable and incompetent <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</dd>

    <dt>Relatedness</dt>
    <dd> Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with the people in the environment,
      rather
      than feeling lonely or unnoticed <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</dd>

    <dt>Popularity</dt>
    <dd>Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than feeling like a person whose
      advice
      and opinion are ignored <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</dd>

    <dt>Stimulation</dt>
    <dd>Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure instead of feeling bored and understimulated
      <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</dd>

    <dt>Security</dt>
    <dd>Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather than feeling uncertain and
      threatened by circumstances one cannot control <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</dd>
  </dl>


  <p>In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the approach of
    Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P.
    Anderson, for example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model <cite>(→ FIG. 05)</cite>. Rather than focusing on
    the psychological side of the user needs, this model is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes
    that products proceed through six stages of maturity, during which they can grow from a purely functional product,
    to a product that is meaningful to the user <cite>(ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.)</cite>.</p>
